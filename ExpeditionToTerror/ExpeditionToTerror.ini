name.English=Expedition to Terror - V2.1
synopsys.English=You lead an excursion into the Brazilian jungle to find a powerful relic.
description.English=This scenario features random events to increase replayability, there is no round limit, and there is a fairly large amount of combat (although some of it is random, so it won't always be in the same quantities).\n\nEvidence is not used, so discard any insanity cards that require the use of Evidence and draw a new one.\n\nUpdate V2 - the scenario is now a little easier for all player counts, ans particularly 2-3 player counts.  There have also been some general quality of life updates.
